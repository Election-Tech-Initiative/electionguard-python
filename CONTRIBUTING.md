## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Before you get started, you should
read the [readme](README.md) and [the design and architecture notes](docs/Design_and_Architecture.md), which describe design & architecture goals of the code and tools & techniques used.

Open source contributions require you to agree to a standard Microsoft Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
