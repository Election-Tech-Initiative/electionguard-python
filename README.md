This repository is a "reference implementation" of ElectionGuard written in Python3. This includes
both a "verifier" application, useful for validating the results of an ElectionGuard election, as
well as a standalone Python library, suitable for building other applications.

## Prerequisites

### Python 3.8+

This code was developed against Python3.8, and is unlikely to work against earlier versions. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### gmpy2 Requirements

To make the math go faster, we're using [Gmpy2](https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which
has its own [installation requirements (native C libraries)](https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installation).

### pipenv

[pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) is used to configure the environment. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv#installation).

### make (optional)

**make** is used to simplify the commands and GitHub Actions. This is built in for MacOS and Linux, but Windows installation instructions can be found [here](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm).

## Quick Start

Using **make**, the entire workflow can be run with one command: `make`

## Setup

**1. Initialize dev environment**

```
pipenv install --dev
```

OR

```
make environment
```

**2. Install `electionguard` module in edit mode**

```
pipenv run python -m pip install -e .
```

OR

```
make install
```

### Windows without Make

Use supplied precompiled **gmpy2** package with the `--find-links` or `-f` option.

**Note:** The 32 vs 64 bit is based on your installed python version NOT your system.
This code snippet will read `true` for 64 bit.

```
python -c 'from sys import maxsize; print(maxsize > 2**32)
```

**32-bit:**

```
pipenv run pip install -f packages/gmpy2-2.0.8-cp38-cp38-win32.whl -e .
```

**64-bit:**

```
pipenv run pip install -f packages/gmpy2-2.0.8-cp38-cp38-win_amd64 -e .
```

## Running

### Option 1: Run test command

```
pipenv run python -m pytest /tests
```

OR

```
make test
```

### Option 2: Run tests in VS Code

Install recommended test explorer extensions and run unit tests through tool.

### Option 3: Code Coverage

```
pipenv run coverage report
```

OR

```
make coverage
```

**Windows:** Be sure to select the [virtual environment Python interpreter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/installing-python-interpreters).
