# TODO: expand this into a supported function in electionguard/encrypt.py
#   This should include generating Chaum-Pedersen decryption proofs over the ElGamal totals.

#   a single CiphertextBallot per ballot style, or what we want to do with
#   races that appear on more than one ballot style. The code below completely
#   blows off the concept of a specific ballot style and just focuses on the
#   better-be-unique selection object-ids.
